# VIM Shortcuts

### NERDTREE

Use the natural Vim navigation keys **`hjkl`** to navigate the files.

**`o`** open the file in a new buffer or open/close directory.

**`t`** open the file in a new tab.

**`i`** open the file in a new horizontal split.

**`s`** open the file in a new vertical split.

**`p`** go to parent directory.

**`r`** refresh the current directory.

**`m`** launch NERDTree menu inside Vim.

### Replace

**`:s/foo/bar/g`** find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.

**`:%s/foo/bar/g`** find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.

**`:%s/foo/bar/gc`** change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

**`:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc`** change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

**`:%s/foo/bar/gci`** change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the `i` flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.`:%s/foo\c/bar/gc` is the same because `\c` makes the search case insensitive.This may be wanted after using `:set noignorecase` to make searches case sensitive (the default).

**`:%s/foo/bar/gcI`** change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the `I` flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.`:%s/foo\C/bar/gc` is the same because `\C` makes the search case sensitive.This may be wanted after using `:set ignorecase` to make searches case insensitive.

The `g` flag means global – each occurrence in the line is changed, rather than just the first
